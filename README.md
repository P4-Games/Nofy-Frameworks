## How it's made?

On this occasion, and as is customary for this team, we have implemented development using EVM-compatible technologies, starting with Solidity, Foundry on Base. Our interface is created in Next.js with FRAMES.JS. All on-chain data is consumed with The Graph. Our APis are deployed
on Google Cloud and assets on Pinata.

- [nextJs Framework](https://nextjs.org/)

## Live Demo

- [Nofy Live Demo](https://farcaster.nof.town)

## Run App

```sh
npm run dev / yarn dev
```

## Use App

```sh
Open browser in http://localhost:3000/
```

## Commit changes

The application uses a linter for commit messages, requiring them to be specified in the following format:

```
- [type] message
- [type] :icono: message
```

Example:

```
- commit -m [chore] add commitlinter
- commit -m [chore] :sparkles: add commitlinter (to commit with an icon, you can use [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/))
```

The allowed standard types are:

```
- feat: A new feature for the user.
- fix: Fixes a bug that affects the user.
- perf: Changes that improve site performance.
- build: Changes in the build system, deployment tasks, or installation.
- ci: Changes in continuous integration.
- docs: Changes in documentation.
- refactor: Code refactoring such as variable or function name changes.
- style: Changes in formatting, tabs, spaces, or semicolons, etc.; do not affect the user.
- test: Adds tests or refactors an existing one.
- chore: Other changes that don't modify src or test files.
- revert: Reverts a previous commit.
```

Failing to comply with these standards will cause the pre-commit to fail. To remove the last commit (without losing changes), run:

```sh
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

For more information, refer to: [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/#/).
